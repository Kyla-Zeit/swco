But in the early 1990s, everything changed. The country I loved descended into chaos, and millions of people were forced to flee their homes. The devastating war destroyed not only infrastructure—schools, hospitals, roads, and markets—but also shattered lives, leaving families without the necessities of life."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"My own family was among those displaced. We fled our hometown seeking safety, finding refuge in neighboring countries. In the midst of the turmoil, we were fortunate to be offered an opportunity to immigrate to Canada as refugees in the early 1990s. This new chapter provided us with security and hope for a better future. But the journey to adapt to a new life—learning a new language, adjusting to a new culture, and rebuilding from the ground up—was not easy. Though grateful for the opportunities Canada provided, I could never forget the struggles of those I left behind, especially the women, children, and families still enduring hardship in Somalia."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"As I built my new life, the memories of my homeland remained vivid, and the desire to make a difference only grew stronger. In 2015, I returned to Somalia for the first time since leaving. I had heard of the country’s ongoing struggles, but nothing could have prepared me for the reality I encountered. Reconnecting with relatives and speaking with local women who had endured years of hardship, I was struck by their incredible resilience in the face of adversity. Through these conversations, I gained a deeper understanding of the gender inequality that pervaded every aspect of life. Women were often denied access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. They were relegated to traditional roles with little opportunity to influence decisions that affected their lives. In a society where men held most of the power, the voices of women were marginalized—or silenced altogether."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"I also learned of the devastating impact of climate change. Prolonged droughts and unpredictable weather patterns had destroyed crops, drained water sources, and exacerbated food insecurity. Many families struggled to survive, while youth—both men and women—faced limited job opportunities, often in unsafe and exploitative conditions."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"This visit was a turning point for me. The poverty and hardship I witnessed were overwhelming, but so too was the strength and determination of the people, especially the women. Many were running small businesses, initiating community projects, and working tirelessly to improve their children’s lives. I realized how critical it was to empower these women, their families, and their communities—not only to address immediate needs but to create sustainable paths toward long-term development."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"In the years that followed, I felt a deep calling to contribute to positive change in Somalia. The challenges the country faced were too great to ignore. I asked myself, what can I do to help? In 2018, I founded Samawada, a community bridge-building organization with a mission to create lasting change in Somalia. The name Samawada means “carrying something good,” which reflects the organization’s vision: to bring hope, opportunity, and lasting solutions to communities in need. The creation of Samawada is deeply personal—it grew from the tragic displacement of my family and the desire to make a tangible difference. But it is also a call to action. A call to fight against inequality, environmental degradation, and the forces that trap communities in cycles of poverty. Through Samawada, we are working to create opportunities, restore dignity, and build a future where the people of Somalia—especially women—can thrive."}]]}]]}]}],null],null],null]},[null,["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","journey","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined"}]],null]},[[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/swco/_next/static/css/8fbe185906a05f8e.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined"}],["$","link","1",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/swco/_next/static/css/04ddb8ea7c11f0fa.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"__variable_0aec7f
